## Authentication                                                             

Is the assurance that information transaction is from the source it claims to be from. The device authenticates itself prior to receiving or transmitting any information. It assures that the information received is authentic. This requirement is applied in the device. This requirement is applied in the communications via Internet. This requirement is applied in the Cloud. This requirement is applied in the database.                                  

Not addressing this requirement may lead to vulnerabilities explored by attacks such as:                                                              

  *Node Replication:
   When an attacker copies the identity of an user and send false data in his name.                                                                     

  *Sinkhole Attack:
   In this attack some nods are made more attractive than others by tampering with the routing information, when arriving to the sinkhole node the messages may be dropped or altered. 

  *Impersonation Attack:                                                     
   In this attack the attacker pretends to be one of the users of the system to fulfill is bad intentions.
