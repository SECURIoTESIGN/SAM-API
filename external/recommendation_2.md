Is the property of safeguarding the correctness and completeness of assets in an IoT system. In other words it involves maintaining the data consistent, trustworthy and accurate during it life-cycle. This requirement is applied in the Cloud. This requirement is applied in the database. 

Not addressing this requirement may lead to vulnerabilities explored by attacks such as:
