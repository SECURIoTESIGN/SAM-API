Not addressing this requirement may lead to vulnerabilities explored by attacks such as:  
                                                           
*SQL Injection Attacks:
In this type of attack, the attacker inserts malicious code with the  e thintention of accessing the  unauthorized database for the purpose of obtaining confidential or critical data from the legitimate user. 
    
*Wrapping Attacks:                                               
In a wrapping attack scenario, the attacker duplicates the SOAP message in the course of the translation and sends it to the server as a legitimate user. Therefore, the attacker may interfere with the malicious code. 
     
* MITM Attacks:                                                              
In this type of attack, an attacker attempts to intrude on a mail exchange or continuous message between two users or clients of a cloud-based mobile  application (client-server).                                                     

* Cookie Poisoning:                                                           
This type of attack consists of replacing or modifying cookie content in ways to gain unauthorized access to applications or Web pages.
